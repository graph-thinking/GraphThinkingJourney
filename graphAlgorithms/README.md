# Graph Algorithms

We try to be domain agnostic but not problem agnostic and also to be updated with recents graph theory discovery and graph technologies.

The first part is on optimization - network optimization - graph optimization that belong to Operational Research. 

This is a big picture of what is [Operational Research](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-big-picture-of-operations-research-8652d5153aad). These are some [exercises](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~liberti/teaching/dix/inf572-10/exercises-nosol.pdf)
