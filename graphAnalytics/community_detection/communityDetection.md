Community Detection

[References Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/community/)
    
  cluster your graph based on relationships to find communities where members have more significant interactions. 
  This category includes popular algorithms â€“ such as Connected Components and Louvain Modularity. 
  Detecting communities helps predict similar behavior, find duplicate entities or simply prepare data for other analyses.
