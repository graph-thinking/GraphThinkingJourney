# Initiation to Graph Thinking

This course is intended to be a base for a graph thinking journey. 
It covers an [introduction](./initiationGraphThinking/README.md) to learn to solve problems with graphs, followed by an [analytics part](./graphAnalytics/README.md) and a [solution production ready one](./graphProductionReady/README.md).

There are no isolated pieces of information in this connected world, but rich and connected domains all around us. Graph Database embraces relationships as a core aspect of its data model to store, process, and query connections efficiently.

Understanding the connections between data, and deriving meaning from these links, doesn’t necessarily mean gathering new data. Significant insightscan be drawn from one’s existing data, simply by reframing the problem and looking at it in a new way: as a Graph.


I would like to structure the journey inspired by the system [six sigma belts](https://www.sixsigmadaily.com/the-human-aspect-of-six-sigma-the-belt-system/), providing certifications for a graph thinking problem solver and assigning him a belt in according to his level. Then he will be a graph thinking samurai with green belt for example. It will be online and publicy available the meaning of each belt.
