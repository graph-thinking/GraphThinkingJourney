# Initiation to Graph Thinking

This course is intended to be a base for a graph thinking journey. 
It covers an [introduction](./initiationGraphThinking/README.md) to learn to solve problems with graphs, followed by an [analytics part](./graphAnalytics/README.md) and a [production ready one](./bigGraphAnalytics/README.md).

I would like to structure as [six sigma belts](https://www.sixsigmadaily.com/the-human-aspect-of-six-sigma-the-belt-system/)
