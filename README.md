# Graph Thinking Journey

There are no isolated pieces of information in this connected world, but rich and connected domains all around us. Graph Database embraces relationships as a core aspect of its data model to store, process, and query connections efficiently.

Understanding the connections between data, and deriving meaning from these links, doesn’t necessarily mean gathering new data. Significant insightscan be drawn from one’s existing data, simply by reframing the problem and looking at it in a new way: as a Graph.

From a metaphysic perspective we all belongs to an [Universal Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_graph).

This course is intended to be a base for a graph thinking journey. 
It covers an [introduction](./initiationGraphThinking/README.md) to learn to solve problems with graphs (shortest path not persistent and persistent), followed by a classification of all [graph algorithms](./graphAlgorithms/README.md) and a [solution production ready one (shortest path)](./graphProductionReady/README.md).

Then there are two subfields - one is semantic and the other is network.

The structure of the journey has been inspired by the [six sigma belts system](https://www.sixsigmadaily.com/the-human-aspect-of-six-sigma-the-belt-system/), providing certifications for a graph thinking problem solver and assigning him a belt in according to his level. It will be online and publicy available the meaning of each belt.
A graph thinking samurai with green belt for example will be clear what he masters.
