# Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) 

We are inspired by such [foundation](https://www.ekgf.org/)

We perform an audit on connectedness and semantic maturity following such [guidelines](https://wixlabs-pdf-dev.appspot.com/assets/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fpdfproxy%3Finstan[â€¦]com%2Fugd%2Fffbc4e_cbc43fe8aa7f47cd8e7f262480200208.pdf)

A guide for how to build from scratch a knowledge graph (KG) using as much as 
possible open technologies (open standard - open source - open data) that is agnostic (domain independent) and could be built on top of present enterprise technology in an incremenal and impactless way.

This is a conference on KG - https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/about/

The origin of KG - https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/3/250711-knowledge-graphs/fulltext

The project is inspired by [Google Knowledge Graph](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-knowledge-graph/369484/)
and also [Wolfran Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/tour/)

## Building a KG steps

Hereinafter to switch paradigm from search things not to search strings :

0. [General Purpose Architecture](./architecture.md)

1. [General Purpose Graph Modelling and Taxonomy](./graph_modelling.md)

2. [General Purpose Ingestion and pre-ingestion](./ingestion.md)

3. [General Purpose Processing and actions](./actions.md)

In according to the functional requirements we customize the general purpose solution.
