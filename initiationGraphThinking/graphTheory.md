# Graph Therminology

*  The vertices u and v are called the end vertices of the edge (u,v)
*  If two edges have the same end vertices they are Parallel
*  An edge of the form (v,v) is a loop
*  A Graph is simple if it has no parallel edges and loops
*  A Graph is said to be Empty if it has no edges. Meaning E is empty
*  A Graph is a Null Graph if it has no vertices. Meaning V and E is empty
*  A Graph with only 1 Vertex is a Trivial graph
*  Edges are Adjacent if they have a common vertex. Vertices are Adjacent if they have a common edge
*  The degree of the vertex v, written as d(v), is the number of edges with v as an end vertex. 
*  By convention, we count a loop twice and parallel edges contribute separately
*  Isolated Vertices are vertices with degree 1. d(1) vertices are isolated
*  A Graph is Complete if its edge set contains every possible edge between ALL of the vertices
*  A Walk in a Graph G = (V,E) is a finite, alternating sequence of the form ViEiViEi consisting of vertices and edges of the graph G
* A Walk is Open if the initial and final vertices are different. A Walk is Closed if the initial and final vertices are the same
*  A Walk is a Trail if ANY edge is traversed atmost once
*  A Trail is a Path if ANY vertex is traversed atmost once (Except for a closed walk)
*  A Closed Path is a Circuit â€“ Analogous to electrical circuits''
