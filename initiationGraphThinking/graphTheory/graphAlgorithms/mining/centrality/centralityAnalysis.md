# Centrality Analysis 
   reveal which nodes are important based on graph topology. They identify influential nodes based on their position 
   in the network and include the famous PageRank algorithm. These algorithms are used to infer group dynamics 
   such as credibility, rippling vulnerability and bridges between groups.
