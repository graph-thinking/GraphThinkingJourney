Link Prediction [Graph ML](https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/how-to-get-started-with-graph-machine-learning-afa53f6f963a) and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/linkprediction/)
  
Consider the proximity of nodes in a graph as well as structural elements, such as possible triangles between nodes, to predict the likelihood of a new relationship forming in the future or that undocumented connections exist.
Preferential Attachment is included in this class of algorithms that has many applications, from drug
