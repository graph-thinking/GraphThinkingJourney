# Path Finding 

(theory + jupyter notebook link)  

[References Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/pathfinding/)
  
  are foundational to graph analytics and find the most efficient or shortest paths to traverse between nodes. 
   The A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms are included in this category, which are used to understand complex dependencies
   and evaluate routes for uses such as physical logistics and least-cost call or IP routing.

Algorithm | Complexity O(V,E) | Challenge
--- | --- | ---
**Things** | _Don't_ | [Need](http://makeuseof.com)
All pairs Shortest Path | *__Look__* | Figure out traffic load capacity and plan distribution or logistics in an urban area
Minimum Weight Spanning Tree | *__Look__* | Create a low-cost tour of a travel destination
