# Initiation Graph Thinking

This course is as introduction to graph thinking. 

Audience : people whose job is data-related but doesn't necessary have programming skills.

* how graphs can solve problems [very short explication](https://github.com/JohnLaTwC/Shared/blob/master/Defenders%20think%20in%20lists.%20Attackers%20think%20in%20graphs.%20As%20long%20as%20this%20is%20true%2C%20attackers%20win.md) - [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/703999/what-are-good-examples-of-problems-that-graphs-can-solve-better-than-the-alterna) and [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-real-world-problems-that-graph-theory-can-solve)
